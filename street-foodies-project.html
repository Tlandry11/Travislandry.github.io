          <h1>Street Foodies: Delivery service app</h1>
          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>Food trucks grew in popularity during 2008 recession. Over the years, it became a consumer’s favorite because of the convenience and delicious food.  Food Truck entrepreneur usually get into the business because they love to cook and its convenient to be in multiple locations instead of brick-and-mortar store. Since popularity, food trucks have become very competitive in certain cities around the US.</p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Street Foodies allows a delivery service to expand their network to more 
            customers beyond their radius. Similar to Door Dash and Uber Eats, users can sign up to do delivery and make extra money. On the consumer side, this allows them to try new foods without the long wait lines and searching for the food truck’s location on different days. During festival and events, Street Foodies can be active so employees can deliver their food to them like a restaurant.</p>
          <h2>Our Mission</h2> 
          <p>Our mission is to partner with food trucks and street 
            vendors to deliver authentic street food to homes and jobs nearby. This is not your typical fast food restaurants that own franchises, more so homegrown and delicious meals that foodies (users) wont find anywhere else but their favorite spot.</p>
            <h2>Our Foodies</h2>
            <p>We refer our customers and users as Foodies. Our foodies keep us in business while we keep them happy with delicious foods. Our friendly food trucks and street vendors provide the best customer service to have our foodies (users) order again.</p>
            <h2>Our Tradition</h2>
            <p>Street food has been around for many years made with love and care from different ethnicities in various forms of food. We strive to create the best foodie experience with the best street food locally in the area. We want many people to try these vendors and experience a different culture of food.</p>
            <h2>Our Vendors</h2>
            <p>We want to help small businesses such as food trucks and street vendors expand their market beyond the block they occupy. This allows vendors to have a online 
              presents to deliver their authentic food across town to foodies (users) who don’t live in the area or want to try something new.</p>
